N-Vibe

N-Vibe is a navigation-based iOS application that provides a seamless and intuitive user experience with various features, including route calculation, display, and creative UI design. Developed as part of a technical assessment for the N-Vibe iOS Developer position, this app leverages the latest iOS development practices and integrates powerful features to create a unique and engaging experience.

Introduction

N-Vibe is a Swift-based iOS app that integrates map navigation, route calculation, and a highly interactive interface. It is designed to allow users to plan their routes, view live location data, and seamlessly interact with the interface while providing an enjoyable experience. The project was built as a demonstration of technical skills, focusing on code structure, navigation, and user interface design.

Key Highlights:
Programmatic navigation with Mapbox API integration.
Separation of logic for route calculation and display.
Dynamic UI components with smooth interactions.
Well-structured codebase that adheres to best practices for scalable iOS development.

Features

Interactive Navigation: Calculates and displays routes, allowing users to easily navigate through the app.
Smooth UI Transitions: Creative and responsive interface that adapts based on user interactions.
Real-time Updates: Features like live location tracking and route updates.
Customizable Map View: Integrated map service (Mapbox), with custom route markers and overlays.
Separation of Concerns: Logic for route calculation is cleanly separated from UI display, making it easy to maintain and extend.

Installation

To get started with the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/issamAlshamlat/N-Vibe.git
